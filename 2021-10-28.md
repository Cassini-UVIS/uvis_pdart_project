# UVIS Calib meeting

Date: 2021-10-28

## Participants
* Michael Aye (MA)
* Bob West (BW)
* Josh Elliot (JE)
* Todd Bradley (TB)

## Agenda

* JE and MA discuss wavelength grid and how it should not be equi-distant, as evident from the IDL function calculating the wavelengths
* MA presents new status of Steffl Calib efforts
* MA points out that there is a "simple" column-to-column correction that only works for EUV, but not FUV due to the lack of occultation slit used for FUV observations (due to MgF2 lens support structure in the FOV.)
* We discuss two questions MA has:
  * For the column-to-column sensitivity variation, after calculating the average of the triplet columns the text says to divide by the individual pixel values but is not clear on which precisely, as they are 3 different pixel values for triplet.
  * As each averaging operation only creates correction factors for the first column `i` of the set of `i, i+4, i+8`, MA presumes that it must be the pixel values of column i at scan m=0.
  * BW suggests to contact Steffl over this question
  * BW also suggest after having corrections implemented to plot a triplet again, as the three columns with same light should look much closer now, as they got the same light.

## New Action Items

* MA to check if all label wavelengths are the same now.
* MA to plot the triplet after corrections
